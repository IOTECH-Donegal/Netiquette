# Netiquette

This is a single guide as to how to contribute to the projects in this account. It follows what I currently believe to be best practice. Technology being what it is, I am always out of date!

### Repo Setup
Each new repo has the branches:
- main
- test
- dev

Code is only every added as a feature branch in dev and must have passed a unit test before moving from dev to test.

Before moving code from test to main, it must pass integration tests.
